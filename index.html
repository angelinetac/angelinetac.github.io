			<h1>I am Angeline.</h1>
			<p>
				I try to be an octopus by putting my feet into everything. You will read more about it later. It doesn't always end well though. Therefore, my latest area of interest is <strong>PRODUCTIVITY</strong>. I read anything that can help me to improve my time management skills.

				<h3>Maria's SteakCafe</h3> 
				<p>
					This is where I started venturing into business. My biggest achievement to date is probably setting up the latest branch in <em>Jalan Maarof, Bangsar</em>. Serving the best steaks in town, recipes crafted by my very own Mummy.

				<h3>The Foodsmith Co</h3> 
				<p>
					This is my new baby. It's a real challenge to get an F&B business running. Chefs go missing. Plenty of food wastage. So, <strong>The Foodsmith Co</strong> aspires to help small F&B businesses solve their food consistency and staffing problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Besides, sometimes being a restauranteur, I get sick and tired of having to work during service timings<em>i.e. dinner time and weekends</em>. So, the next best bet is to build one that can probably run during normal working hours.

				<h2>Travelling</h2>

				<p>
					Believe it or not, I spent the early years of my working life saving and investing. So, my travel experiences only started when I turned 30.
